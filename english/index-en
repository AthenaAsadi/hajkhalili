            <h1>Handwoven Carpets of Kerman</h1>
            <p>Kerman, as the largest province of Iran, is located in the center of the country. Handwoven carpets of Kerman, like other origins of handwoven carpets in Iran, have specific and distinct features. One of the most important characteristics of Kerman carpets is the three-ply structure of these carpets; in this structure, two thick wefts and one thin weft are present in the structure of the carpet.

                Weavers in Kerman province use two knotting styles: Persian and Turkish. In some rural areas, the Turkish knot style is used, while in central areas, the Persian knot style is employed. The difference between Persian and Turkish knots is in the knotting technique and the structure of the carpets. Carpets woven in the Turkish method are usually sturdy and very thick, whereas carpets woven in the Persian method are soft and thin.
                
                Additionally, the dyeing of fibers in Kerman is mostly done traditionally; one of the characteristics of dyeing natural fibers in this region is dyeing natural wool before spinning. This process helps in better dyeing and uniformity of the fibers.
                
                One of the most important characteristics of handwoven carpets of Kerman is the very high diversity of weaving styles and the wide range of color palettes in this region.</p>
